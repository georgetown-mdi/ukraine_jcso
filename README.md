## "The Digital Trail of Ukraine’s 2022 Refugee Exodus"
This repository contains code accompanying the article "The Digital Trail of Ukraine’s 2022 Refugee Exodus." 

## This Repository
Regretfully, we are not able to share the migration data. But we would still like to share the code implementing our methodology. Consequently, we generate artificial data in the file `python/synthetic_data.py` which is stored in the file `proc_data/syn_y.csv`. 

Our preprocessed organic data is avialable as `proc_data/ukraine_X.csv`. 

## Installation
This analysis was conducted using Python 3.7.6. 
The `requirements.txt file` contains the modules used for this project, and can be installed via    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```    
in this directory.

Some scripts assume that the root directory of this repository is the working directory.

Our main analysis occurs in the following files:
 - The file `international_eda.py` creates Figure 2, which gives the correlation between our prediction data. 
 - The file `viz_fits.py` creates Figure 5, which shows the fit provided by each data source.
 - The file `lag_or_lead.py` creates Figure 6, which shows lag and window estimated for each data source.
 - The file `international_pred.py` creates Figure 7, which performs a predictive evaluation.
